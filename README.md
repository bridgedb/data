# data

Repository to mimic the old `data/gene_database/` API, available at [https://bridgedb.github.io/data/gene_database/](gene_database/).

The input is a JSON file from which the `gene_database/readme.md` is autogenerated
with the scripts in this folder:

```shell
groovy update.groovy > gene_database/readme.md
```

A second script generated `gdb.config` content for BridgeDb servers:

```shell
groovy makeGDBconfig.groovy
```

## data model

The data model for each identifier mapping file looks like this:

```json
{
      "species": "Human Coronaviruses",
      "file":    "humancorona-2021-11-27.bridge",
      "downloadURL": "https://zenodo.org/record/5734440/files/humancorona-2021-11-27.bridge?download=1",
      "doi": "10.5281/zenodo.5734440",
      "license": "http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/",
      "date": "2021-11-27",
      "size": "2.1 MB"
}
```

The `species` field is not always a species, like in the above example or for metabolites. The `file` and `size` fields
are the filename and exact size of the mapping file, and the `downloadURL` the exact URL to directly download
the Derby file ready for use. The `doi` and `license` field is the DOI and (open) license associated with the
data release.

For the `date` field, this is the data when the data was released. This could be the date when the archive was
released (so, the release date of the DOI record) or the data when the original data from which the Derby file
was created was released. For example, it could be the Ensembl release date for gene/protein mapping data.
